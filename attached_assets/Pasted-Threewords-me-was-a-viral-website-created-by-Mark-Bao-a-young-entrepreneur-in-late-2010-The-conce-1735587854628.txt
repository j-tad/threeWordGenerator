Threewords.me was a viral website created by Mark Bao, a young entrepreneur, in late 2010. The concept was simple yet engaging: users could describe their friends or other users in just three words34. Here's what we know about the site:
Background and Creation
Created by Mark Bao, who was 18 years old at the time47.
Launched as a side project to experiment with viral marketing and explore the idea of getting honest opinions about oneself4.
The site went live in December 2010 and quickly gained traction39.
Viral Success
Within three weeks of its launch, the site had:
A quarter of a million users
5 million total visitors
4.3 million words submitted
17 million page views4
At one point, it received more than 220,000 pageviews in just 2 hours10.
Functionality
Users could sign up through Facebook Connect3.
Each user got a personalized link (e.g., http://threewords.me/username)[3].
Visitors could describe the user in three words, optionally anonymously34.
Users could customize their page with a personal background and avatar3.
Reasons for Success
Low barrier to entry
Viral spreading mechanism
People's natural curiosity about others' opinions of them34
Outcome

It was purchased by Kevin Ham, an internet entrepreneur known for owning valuable domain names4.
